1. For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally
expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be
better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.
(a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors $p$ is small.
(b) The number of predictors $p$ is extremely large, and the number of observations n is small.
(c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.
(d) The variance of the error terms, i.e. $\sigma^2 = Var(\epsilon),$ is extremely high.
